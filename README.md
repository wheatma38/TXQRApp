This is the data branch.

It contains builds of the app.

I picked this approach kind of randomly for convenience, and am happy for it to change
to anything else.  See https://github.com/ArtemSBulgakov/buildozer-action#to-branch

It has the nice side effect of storing a git log of the binaries, which helps
manage checksumming them all in one convenient and easy-to-verify way.
