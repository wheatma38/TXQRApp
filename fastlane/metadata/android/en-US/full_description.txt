Barebones visual data communication via QR codes, written in Kivy Python, which
is theoretically cross platform to iOS and desktop.

This is a quick start at an easy successor to QRStream, inspired by comments on
its issues pages.  DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE HELP NEEDED.  The developer is
struggling with a degenerative brain disease.  The app tries to convert files
to and from barcode videos.  It has not been tested much, yet.

This is obviously not a secure solution to communication on its own.  The
encoding/decoding libraries may have many bugs, and using QR codes instead of
OCR scanning means it is easier to hide malicious data in the transmission
without you noticing.  Your android device likely also has multiple radios and
such, that can surreptitiously transfer data with electronic devices via
electromagnetic coupling, severely weakening your airgap unless removed.  There
are also many other known ways to transfer malicious data across an airgap,
including audio, temperature fluctuations, and reappropriating parts of the
device wiring as more ad-hoc antennae.  Your chips have backdoors, technology
has shifted to ML, etc etc etc.  Meanwhile, many people may have no clue how to
make use of any of that stuff, even many fancy secret agent types.
